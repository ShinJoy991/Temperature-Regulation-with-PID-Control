# Temperature-Regulation-with-PID-Control

- This is my instruction of how to implement a PID control system to control temperature.

- Due to its modest scale, this project is particularly suitable for students and novices seeking to gain proficiency in PID control methodologies.

- Employing a combination of Matlab, Simulink, and Arduino, this project can achieve a temperature control with precision of ±0.5°C.

- If you notice any serious mistake, issue me to fix it.
